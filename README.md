# code-refactoring

## Description

    This project helped me to further understand the application and workflow of semantic HTML while showing me easier ways to condense repetetive CSS code elements. 

    The webpage is complete with descriptions of the services and benefits that are offered by the company, accompanied by internal nav links to elements on the webpage. Other features of the page include visually capturing color schemes, along with images relating to the services and benefits that are being advertised.

## Usage

    When a user visits this webpage they'll be greeted with the comapny name formatted with 2 colors in the font, and an internal navigation bar allowing them to navigate throughout the webpage. When using the nav bar they will be directed to the services offered by the comapny, along with descriptions of those applications. The user will also see an aside tab contaning the benefits available to them as well.
